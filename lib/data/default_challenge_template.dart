const String defaultChallengeTemplate = '''
Day 1: Conduct a complete life audit. Document every commitment, project, relationship, and recurring task consuming your time and mental energy. Be ruthlessly honest - include the things you're avoiding, the half-finished projects haunting you, and the people draining your energy. Create three lists: Active (working on now), Stalled (should do but avoiding), Dead (need to kill or delegate). This isn't about judgment, it's about seeing the battlefield clearly before you can win the war.

Day 2: Write your Anti-Vision in vivid, painful detail. Not what you want - what happens if you continue current patterns for 5 years. Where will you be? What will you look like? How will you feel waking up? What opportunities will you have missed? What relationships will have deteriorated? Make it so uncomfortable that staying the same becomes more painful than changing. This is your "never again" moment. Pin it where you'll see it daily. Your future self is watching - show them you saw this coming and chose differently.

Day 3: Define your Morning Vow. Not what you'll do, but what you absolutely will NOT do today. Make it specific and measurable. Not "be productive" but "I will not check social media before 12pm." Not "eat healthy" but "I will not eat processed sugar." The Vow must be something you can clearly succeed or fail at by day's end. Write it first thing when you wake. This single commitment, kept daily, builds the discipline muscle that changes everything. Start small but be absolute - better to keep a small vow than break a large one.

Day 4: Achieve Inbox Zero. Process every email, message, notification, and communication sitting in your digital inboxes. For each item: Delete it (90% of things), Do it immediately (if under 2 minutes), Delegate it (if someone else can handle), or Defer it (schedule a specific time to address). The goal isn't just empty inboxes - it's training your brain to make decisions quickly instead of letting things pile up as mental debt. Clear inboxes mean clear mind. Today you prove you can handle your entire information stream in one focused session.

Day 5: Identify your Top 3 Strategic Priorities for this year. Not 10 goals, not a vision board - three specific outcomes that would make this year successful regardless of what else happens. For each priority, write exactly what success looks like in concrete terms. "Get fit" is not a priority. "Reach 15% body fat and run a half marathon" is a priority. These three become your filter for every decision. Does this move you toward the Top 3? Do it. Does it distract from them? Say no. Pin these where you see them every morning.

Day 6: Eliminate one time-wasting habit completely. Not reduce it, eliminate it. Delete one app that's draining your attention. Unsubscribe from one service you're paying for but not using. Block one website you habitually check but gain nothing from. Remove one recurring commitment that doesn't serve your Top 3. Make it permanent - don't just hide the app, delete your account. Don't just unsubscribe, block the sender. This isn't about willpower, it's about removing the option entirely. You can't waste time on something that's no longer accessible.

Day 7: Conduct your first Weekly Review. Analyze the past 6 days with brutal honesty. Did you keep your Morning Vow each day? Did you make progress on your Top 3 priorities? What worked? What failed? What patterns emerged? Document three wins (things that worked), three failures (things that didn't), and three adjustments (what you'll change next week). This review isn't optional - it's the feedback loop that turns random actions into systematic improvement. Schedule it for the same time every week going forward.

Day 8: Create your Task Zero system. Choose ONE task management method and migrate everything into it. Not multiple apps, not scattered notes, not mental tracking - one single source of truth for every task, project, and commitment. Whether it's Notion, Todoist, physical notebook, or something else doesn't matter. What matters is everything lives there and you check it daily. Spend today moving every scattered task, every "I should do this," every half-remembered commitment into the system. Tomorrow you wake up knowing exactly what needs doing because it's all captured in one place.

Day 9: Design your ideal daily schedule with specific time blocks. Not vague intentions but actual calendar blocks: 6-8am deep work, 8-9am admin, 9-10am email, etc. Block time for everything important including breaks, exercise, and reflection. The key insight: if it's not scheduled, it doesn't exist. Your calendar is a contract with yourself. Today's task is designing the schedule, not yet following it - that comes tomorrow. Be realistic about energy levels. Schedule hard creative work when you're sharp, not after 8 hours of meetings.

Day 10: Implement the 2-minute rule rigorously for one full day. Any task requiring less than 2 minutes gets done immediately - no deferring, no adding to lists, no "I'll do it later." Reply to that message now. File that document now. Make that quick call now. You'll discover how many small tasks accumulate into major mental overhead. By handling them immediately, you keep your mental RAM clear for actual important work. Track how many 2-minute tasks you complete today - the number will shock you and reveal how much mental energy you've been wasting on task management instead of task completion.

Day 11: Set up one automated system that handles a recurring task. Set up automatic bill payments. Create email filters that file or delete categories of messages. Set up automatic backups. Configure a script that handles a repetitive process. The goal isn't just saving time - it's removing decisions from your life. Every automated system is one less thing requiring your attention, one less decision draining your energy. Spend today building one automation, then add one new automation every week going forward. In six months, you'll have 25+ tasks running on autopilot.

Day 12: Execute a complete digital declutter. Delete unused apps from phone and computer. Archive or delete old files. Organize your desktop - zero icons is the goal. Clear your downloads folder. Delete old photos and videos you'll never look at again. Unsubscribe from newsletters you don't read. Leave Slack workspaces and Discord servers you don't engage with. Every piece of digital clutter is a tiny attention tax. Today you're declaring bankruptcy on digital debt and starting fresh. Your digital environment should be as clean as an operating room.

Day 13: Establish your Evening Ritual - a 15-minute shutdown routine you do every single day. Review what you accomplished today against your plan. Clear your desk/workspace completely. Write tomorrow's Top 3 tasks. Set out anything you'll need tomorrow. Process any loose papers or notes. Close all browser tabs and apps. This ritual signals to your brain that work is over, allowing you to actually rest instead of carrying work stress into evening and sleep. Without this boundary, you're always "sort of working" and never fully present. The ritual is your off switch.

Day 14: Conduct Weekly Review #2 and assess your first two weeks. Compare Week 2 to Week 1 - are you keeping your Morning Vows more consistently? Have you made measurable progress on your Top 3 priorities? Are your systems holding up or breaking down? Identify which practices are becoming habits versus which ones you're fighting. Double down on what's working. Kill or modify what isn't. This isn't about perfection - it's about the trajectory. Are you moving toward the person you need to become, even if slowly? If yes, keep going. If no, change course now.

Day 15: Implement dedicated Deep Work blocks - minimum 2 hours of uninterrupted focus on your most important work. Phone on airplane mode. Computer on Do Not Disturb. Door closed. Calendar blocked. This isn't about working longer, it's about working on what matters without constant interruption. Most people never experience true deep work because they're always one notification away from distraction. Today you're proving you can sustain focus for 2 solid hours. Track what you accomplish - you'll do more meaningful work in this block than most people do in a full day of "busy work."

Day 16: Practice radical single-tasking for the entire day. One task, start to completion or natural stopping point, then next task. No tab-switching, no "quick checks," no parallel processing. If you think of something while working, write it down and return to current task. The goal is experiencing what it's like to give something your complete attention. You'll discover how rarely you actually do this and how much more effective it is than scattered multitasking. Single-tasking isn't about being slow - it's about finishing things instead of having 20 things 50% done.

Day 17: Identify and eliminate your biggest distraction for 24 hours minimum. Not just reduce it - remove it completely. If it's social media, delete the apps and use browser blockers. If it's news, block all news sites. If it's a person, don't interact with them today. If it's Slack, uninstall it and tell your team you're unavailable until tomorrow. Experience what it feels like to remove your primary escape mechanism. Notice when you reach for it (you will, repeatedly) and observe what you're avoiding. The distraction isn't the problem - it's the symptom. What are you using it to avoid?

Day 18: Create or produce something tangible today. Write an article. Build a prototype. Design something. Code a feature. Create a video. Make something that didn't exist this morning. Not planning it, not researching it - actually making it. And if possible, share it publicly before the day ends. The goal is breaking the cycle of endless preparation and actually shipping. Imperfect output beats perfect planning. You'll learn more from creating and shipping one thing than from planning and researching a hundred things. Make, ship, learn. Repeat.

Day 19: Review and optimize one of your systems that's causing friction. Maybe Task Zero is too complex. Maybe your schedule is unrealistic. Maybe your Evening Ritual takes too long. Pick the system that's hardest to maintain and redesign it to be simpler and more sustainable. The best system is the one you'll actually use consistently, not the theoretically perfect one you'll abandon in two weeks. Simplicity beats sophistication. Consistency beats intensity. Today you're making one system so easy you can't fail at it.

Day 20: Practice saying "No" to something that doesn't serve your Top 3 priorities. A meeting invitation, a social commitment, a project request, a favor someone asks. Not maybe, not "let me think about it" - a clear, immediate no. "I can't take that on right now" is a complete sentence. You don't owe anyone a detailed explanation for protecting your time. Every yes to something unimportant is a no to something important. Today you're proving you can protect your priorities even when it's uncomfortable. The right people will respect it. The wrong people will get mad - which tells you everything.

Day 21: Weekly Review #3 - analyze your three-week transformation. Look at Week 1 vs Week 3. Which habits have stuck? Which systems are working? Where are you still struggling? Calculate your Morning Vow success rate over 21 days - anything above 80% is excellent. Review progress on your Top 3 priorities - even small movement is winning. The question isn't "Am I perfect?" but "Am I different than I was three weeks ago?" If yes, you're on the right track. If no, the remaining 9 days are your chance to actually commit instead of just trying.

Day 22: Track your energy levels throughout the day to identify peak performance windows. Set alarms for every 2 hours and rate your energy, focus, and motivation on a 1-10 scale. Notice patterns - when are you sharpest? When do you crash? Most people schedule their hardest work when it's convenient, not when they're capable. After today, you'll know your biological prime time and can schedule accordingly. Deep work goes in high-energy blocks. Admin goes in medium-energy blocks. Meetings go in low-energy blocks. Match task difficulty to energy availability.

Day 23: Implement task batching - group similar tasks and process them in dedicated blocks. All email in one session, all calls in one block, all admin in one window. Context-switching is expensive - every time you shift between different types of work, your brain needs 15+ minutes to fully engage. By batching similar tasks, you eliminate most context-switching and get more done in less time. Today, reorganize your schedule to batch everything. You'll feel the difference immediately - less mental fatigue even though you're completing more tasks.

Day 24: Conduct a relationship audit. List every professional relationship in your life. Who energizes you? Who drains you? Who pushes you to grow? Who enables your worst habits? You become the average of the people you spend time with - is your average rising or falling? Today isn't about cutting people off, it's about seeing clearly. Some relationships deserve more time. Some deserve less. Some deserve to end. Make one change today - spend more time with one person who raises your standard or reduce time with one person who lowers it.

Day 25: You're 5 days from completing this challenge. Today, design your NEXT 30-day challenge. Don't wait until Day 30 and then wonder what comes next - momentum dies in the gap between challenges. Based on what you've learned about yourself in the past 24 days, what's the next mountain to climb? What skill needs building? What habit needs forming? What project needs completing? Draft the framework today. By Day 30, you should be ready to roll directly into your next transformation without losing steam. Champions don't take breaks between rounds - they move from victory to victory.

Day 26: Achieve Guilt Zero. Review every incomplete task, every unfulfilled commitment, every "I should do this" lingering in your mind. For each one, make a hard choice: Complete it today, schedule a specific time to do it, delegate it to someone else, or consciously decide NOT to do it and remove it entirely. The goal isn't doing everything - it's making peace with your choices. Guilt comes from tasks in limbo. Today you eliminate limbo. Everything is either done, scheduled, delegated, or deliberately abandoned. No more "I should" - only "I will" or "I won't." This is psychological freedom.

Day 27: Share your journey. Write about your transformation over the past 26 days. What changed? What was hard? What surprised you? Post it publicly - a blog post, a Twitter thread, a LinkedIn article, a video. Teaching someone else what you learned cements your own learning. Plus, you never know who needs to hear exactly what you discovered. The goal isn't to brag about your discipline - it's to document the truth about change. If you struggled, say so. If you failed days, admit it. Real transformation stories inspire more than perfect ones because they're believable.

Day 28: Design your maintenance routine for sustaining these systems after the challenge ends. Which practices will you keep daily? Which will you keep weekly? What's the minimum viable routine that maintains your progress? Most people fail not because they can't change, but because they don't plan for after the change. Today you're building the schedule for Day 31 and beyond. What does next week look like? Next month? In six months? You need a plan for normal life, not just challenge mode. Sustainability beats intensity every single time.

Day 29: Conduct a complete pre-completion review. Tomorrow is Day 30, but today is about taking inventory. Pull out your Day 1 life audit and compare it to today. What's different? What progress happened? What's still stuck? Review your Morning Vow log - final success rate? Review your Top 3 priorities - concrete progress made? Look at your calendar - what does your schedule look like compared to Day 1? The goal isn't perfection - it's proof that you're not the same person you were 29 days ago. Document the evidence. You'll need to remember this when things get hard again.

Day 30: Final day. You made it. But this isn't an ending - it's a milestone. Today, commit to your next challenge publicly. Post about starting your next 30-day challenge tomorrow. Share the framework. Declare your new target. This accomplishes two things: it creates accountability for continuing, and it removes the option to "take a break." The person you've become over 30 days isn't the finished version - it's the foundation. Champions don't celebrate completion, they celebrate progress toward the next level. Your future self is still watching. Show them you're just getting started. Day 31 begins tomorrow. Be ready.
